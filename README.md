This is a simple e-commerce website. The website features sections for products, a carousel for promotional banners, and a responsive design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Carousel**: An interactive image slider showcasing the latest promotions or featured products.
- **Product Grid**: Displaying popular and featured products with images and short descriptions.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

# Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Bootstrap**: For the responsive grid system and some UI components like buttons and forms.
- **JavaScript**: For handling interactivity, such as carousel navigation and dynamic content updates.
